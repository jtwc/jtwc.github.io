# Plotting

## Histograms

The histogram is a nice tool for roughly visualizing the distribution a numerical vector.

---

**Exercise:** Run the following code, then look at the help files for `hist` and `truehist` (which is in the MASS library). Describe their differences.
```
library(MASS)
class(Traffic)
names(Traffic)
Traffic$y
hist(Traffic$y)
truehist(Traffic$y)
```

## Scatterplots

Two vectors can be put together into a scatterplot using the `plot` command. The `points` command adds points to an existing plot. The `col` attribute allows you to set the color of the points (used in either `plot` or `points`).
```{r}
plot(1:20, c(1:10, 10:1))
points(1:10, 10:1, col="green")
```
To draw connected line segments instead of points, use `type="l"`; to add line segments to an existing plot, use `lines` (for a pair of vectors) or `curve` (for a function).
```{r}
plot(1:20, c(1:10, 10:1), type="l",
     main="Demonstrating lines")
lines(1:10, 10:1, col="green", lwd=3) # lwd sets line width
curve(log(x), col="blue", add=TRUE)
```

The distribution of a numerical vector can be checked for normality using a *Normal quantile plot* which is a scatterplot of the vector's ordered values paired with idealized ordered values of a truly Normal sample. The R command is `qqnorm`; for example:
```{r fig.height=12}
y <- MASS::Traffic$y
par(mfrow=c(3, 2))
qqnorm(y, main="Traffic")
for(i in 1:5) {
  qqnorm(rnorm(length(y)), main=paste("Normal sample", i))
}
par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
```
The `par(mfrow=c(3, 2))` command told the interpreter to place the next six plots together in a 3 by 2 grid.
